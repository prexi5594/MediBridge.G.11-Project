//Health data form & display
//Display form to add current health metrics and list of previous records


//Health Data Form
//Purpose

//To allow patients to submit their daily/regular health measurements, such as:
//Blood sugar (for diabetes)
//Blood pressure (for hypertension)
//Weight or BMI (optional)
//Notes about symptoms or feelings
//.

//Health Data Display
//What it entails

//Input Fields – fields for the user to type or select their metrics:

//Example: <input type="number" placeholder="Blood Sugar" />

//Submit Button – to save the data.

//Validation – ensure inputs are in correct formats (e.g., numbers >0).

//State Management – using useState or context to store the input temporarily.

//Event Handling – a function like handleSubmit to save the data either:
//To local state for now (student project)

//Or to a backend/API later.
